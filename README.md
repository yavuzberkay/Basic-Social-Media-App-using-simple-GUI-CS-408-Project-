# Basic-Social-Media-App-using-simple-GUI-CS-408-Project-
By using a server and client application, we created a basic social media app where there is a list of users inside server's database 
and each of these users can connect to the server using the client application given that they use the correct port, IP address and username. 
These users can send sweets (messages), follow and block other users, see other people's sweets and disconnect anytime they want. 
They can choose to see the sweets of the people they follow or the sweets of everyone so far. 
They will not see the sweets of the blocked people. 
There is a data exchange between server and client throughout the whole time a client is connected to the server.
